# Modbus

In this project I have used for Modbus Protocol Master and Slave communication Through RS-485.
- Master as ESP32-s3 Slave as ESP32s3:
- master sending data Input from Serial moniter to write 0x400010th address of location.
  - Slave can send data random data to Mater.
  - we can use Modbus Slave software with ESP32s3 Master Device as well as Slave.
